"""Post an automated code review comment on a PR using DeepSeek via OpenRouter.

Run from GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/openrouter-review.yml). Reads
its configuration from environment variables so it needs no CLI arguments:

    OPENROUTER_API_KEY  OpenRouter API key (repo secret)
    GITHUB_TOKEN        Token with pull-requests: write (Actions provides this)
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY   "owner/repo" (Actions provides this)
    PR_NUMBER           Pull request number to review
    PR_HEAD_SHA         SHA of the PR's head commit (Actions provides this)
    GITHUB_BASE_REF     PR base branch (Actions provides this for pull_request
                         events); CLAUDE.md is read from here, not the PR
                         branch, so a PR can't rewrite the review criteria
                         it's judged against

The model is prompted to return a small JSON object (verdict/summary/
findings) which is rendered into a fixed comment template here, rather than
trusting it to produce well-formed markdown directly. Each posted comment
carries a hidden `<!-- deepseek-review-sha: ... -->` marker with the SHA it
reviewed; on a later push, the previous marker is used to also diff and
summarize what changed since that last review.

The PR diff itself is still attacker-controlled text fed to the model, so
its output is a suggestion for a human to weigh, not something acted on
automatically. The workflow checks out the PR's base SHA (not the PR's own
code) before running this script, so a PR cannot modify the script itself
to exfiltrate the secrets in its environment.

Uses only the standard library so the workflow needs no pip install step.

REVIEW_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are an independent code reviewer for a Python/FastAPI backend + Next.js \
frontend project, reviewing a pull request diff. Below is the project's \
CLAUDE.md, documenting its architecture and conventions - use it to judge \
whether the change respects the layering rules and testing conventions.

<CLAUDE.md>
{claude_md}
</CLAUDE.md>

Review the diff for:
- Correctness bugs (logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one, error handling)
- Violations of the router -> service -> repository layering described above
- Missing or inadequate test coverage for the change
- Security issues (injection, secrets, unvalidated input)

Do not comment on formatting or style a linter would catch.

If the diff ends with a note listing files that were omitted because the \
diff was too large, you have not seen those files: do not guess at their \
contents, and say in "findings_markdown" that they were not reviewed.

The user message may also include a second diff showing what changed since \
a previous review of this same PR. If it does, use it to fill in \
"changes_since_last_review_markdown" below, focused on whether it addresses \
issues a reviewer would have raised on the first diff. If it doesn't, set \
that field to null.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object, no markdown code fence and no prose \
outside it, with exactly these keys:
{{
  "verdict": "green" | "yellow" | "red",
  "pr_summary": string, 1-3 plain sentences on what this PR does,
  "findings_markdown": string, a markdown bullet list of specific findings \
with file names, or one sentence saying none were found,
  "changes_since_last_review_markdown": string or null, per the rule above
}}

verdict guide: green = nothing worth a human's attention; yellow = minor \
issues or missing tests, not blocking; red = a correctness bug, security \
issue, or clear layering violation.
